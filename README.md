# CodingQuizzes

My repository for coding quizzes that I post on social media like linkedin.
A code snippet a day keeps the bordome away. :)

## Idea:
Every once in while, whenever I find something interesting/inspiring that cound be used to challenge basic coding skills, I will collect these ideas and publish a little coding quiz.

## Concept: 
Abstract quiz questions from actual coding situation & Try to solve this question in python & C.
BUT, try is by your own. 
Do not use ChatGTP:)

## Quizzes:
